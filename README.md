# ABOUT ME

Hi and welcome to my GitHub domain! I'm Zahar, a recent alumnus of the prestigious Makers Academy, where I completed a rigorous 12-week Software Engineering bootcamp. Makers Academy stands at the forefront of tech education, empowering individuals to pivot their careers and secure coveted positions in the tech sphere.

As a Makers Academy graduate, I've honed a diverse array of skills within agile frameworks, test-driven development, object-oriented programming, and both front- and backend development. My aptitude for swiftly mastering new technologies is complemented by a rich background in finance and ecommerce, alongside hands-on experience with enterprises ranging from startups to industry giants.

My professional journey is underscored by a track record of thriving in high-stakes environments, collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams, and spearheading the development of several MVP projects. This exposure has endowed me with a comprehensive understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from inception to launch.

Drawing from my wealth of experience, I possess an innate knack for delivering tangible results within stringent timelines. My ethos centers on a relentless pursuit of excellence, underpinned by an insatiable curiosity and unwavering commitment to teamwork.

In essence, my arsenal comprises an insatiable thirst for knowledge, adaptability, a results-driven mindset, and a collaborative spirit. I am primed to make a transformative impact on any team fortunate enough to have me aboard.

**My top skills:** quick learner, curious, knowledge hungry, adaptable, results driven, & team player.
